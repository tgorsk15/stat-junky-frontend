Welcome to the Frontend of Stat Junky!  Use this site to pull any two 
past or present NBA players you like and compare their careers and stats directly to 
determine the strengths and weakness of both.

Note: Only the NBA portion of the site is available for use, although there are plans
to continue building out funcitonality for both the NFL and NHL leagues

This project was built using React.js, React Router, CSS, and HTML. A live version of this
site is currently deployed using Netlify and can be found here:

Check out the backend I built to handle route and data requests for this application:
